Suppose, you have to develop software for the manager of a Tourism Management Company named "Berate-jai.com".
Here, the company offers different types of tour packages. All tour packages have some common attributes such as package-id, packga-name
and seat-capacity.(A package have maximum 10 seat- capacity).But , the summer packages have one more attribute
named month (for which the value will e either "January" or "June"). And, the winter packages have an attribute season (for which 
the value will be either "New year" or "Xmas"). Travelers can buy any number of packages and total price will be calculated accordingly.
While calculating the total price , 10% discount will be given to the registered travelers. On the other hand,
non registered customers will no get any discount. A traveler can buy any number of packages until the seat capacity is not full. 
Total price will be calculated by multiplying the number of packages with per package price.
Now, write the code to develop the application. Before writing the code you have to consider the following conditions
strictly.

1. Design each class with proper attributes. Implement the classes considering data hiding and maximum code re-usability. 
2. Write a method for registered travelers so that they can buy two summer packages.
   Also, calculate the total price and print it.
3. Write a method for non registered travelers so that they can buy ten winter packages. 
   Also, calculate the total price and print it.
4. From the main class, create instances and demonstrate the behaviors of the classes.
